# FAQ

## What is the GGUF format?

It is a model format used in a machine learning framework called GGML published by Georgi Gerganov.
One of its features is that information required for language models, such as vocabulary definitions, is included in a single file, making it highly portable.

For details, please see [the official page](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md).

## Do I need a GPU?

No, GPU is optional and it works fine with CPU only.
